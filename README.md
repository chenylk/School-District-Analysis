# School-District-Analysis

## Overview of the school districrt analysis
  * The purpose of this analysis was to analyze different schools in a school district to determine what factors led to successful student performance in standardized math and reading testing. Categories such as budget per capita, school type and school size were examined to determine any trends. After the analysis was done, the school board determined that reading and math scores for the Thomas High School 9th graders were altered. This data was taken out of the data set and the data analysis was reran. 
  
## Results
  * The district summary was affected across the board. Each category decreased after removing the 9th grade scores for math and reading at Thomas High School.

  * The school summary was unchanged for all schools except for Thomas High School, where the 9th grade scores were removed. This is because no other data was altered for any other school with the exception of Thomas High School. 
  
  * The ninth grade scores significantly pulled up the average scores at Thomas High School. The % passing in both math and reading and overall passing rate dropped by about 30 percent.
